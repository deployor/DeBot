# 🚨 **ATTENTION: OLD CODE ALERT!** 🚨

👋 Hey everyone!

Just a **MASSIVE heads-up**: The code currently in this repository is **significantly outdated**! ⏳ Think of it as an ancient relic! 🏛️

---

## ✨ **GOOD NEWS! MAJOR UPDATES INCOMING!** ✨

Most of this codebase has been **completely rewritten and massively improved!** 💪 I'm working hard to get these updates pushed here **VERY SOON!** 🚀 Get ready for something much better!

---

## 🤖 **A Note on DeBot:** 🤖

While the updates are coming, please know that **DeBot cannot be open-sourced at this time.** 🙏 It's currently running in production environments, and frankly, it's got some... *unique quirks* (*read: it's pretty wacky!* 🤪) that need sorting out before it's ready for the public eye.

---

**Thanks for your understanding! Keep an eye on this space for the new code drop!** 🎉
